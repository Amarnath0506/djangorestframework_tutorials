]



Note:
====
If you want to provide documentsation for your API,
django REST Framework as a support

 for that.
 Django REST Swagger , used for generating well Known swagger documentation

get_swagger_view() :
================
is a method, witch will generate  Swagger UI documentation for your API.

This method have two optional parameters.

1) title (of your Swagger documentation) and
2) url (to your Swagger documentation.)


You can customize configuration for your Swagger docs  by defining
"SWAGGER_SETTINGS"  dictionary in your settings.

for example, you can display request headers and list HTTP requests that
allow interacting with them
 (only supported methods will have "Try it out" button.)



SWAGGER_SETTINGS = {

          'SUPPORTED_SUBMIT_METHODS' : [
                                     'get' , 'post',
            ] ,
          'USE_SESSION_AUTH' : False ,
}


If it is also possible to provide customised configuration for your
authentication mechanism.

For instance ,  if you don't want to use Django authentication system for
swagger docs , set USE_SESSION_AUTH to  False  value.

If we do like this there will not be a  Django Login button  on the top of
your docs.
